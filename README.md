<h2> Amazon Movie Review Star Rating Prediction </h2>
<h3> Project Overview </h3> 
This project aims to predict star ratings for Amazon movie reviews based on the review text and metadata. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify reviews into 1-5 star ratings by extracting meaningful insights and patterns from the available data. The project avoids deep learning methods, focusing on feature engineering and traditional machine learning techniques.

<h2> <b> Goals </b> </h2>
Accurate Rating Prediction: Predict the star rating of each review using a variety of features.
Insightful Feature Engineering: Design features that capture review sentiment, user engagement, and other relevant factors to improve model accuracy.
Model Interpretability: Emphasize interpretability and simplicity, using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
